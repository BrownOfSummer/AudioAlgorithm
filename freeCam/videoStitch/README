Panorama frames lists.
Algorithm modify from opencv stitcher class.

We need find keypoint matches(use surf here) for the image list, then calc the homography matrix according the matches, 
then warp the images according to homography to find the connected componet, then find the seam and blend the result.
The matching and paras calculation is time consuming.
(1) simpleStitchFrames.cpp calc paras everytimes, save result in ./tmp/ (mkdir tmp befroe).
    ./simpleStitchFrames /path/to/dir0/ /path/to/dir1/ ....
(2) main.cpp stitchPlane.cpp calc paras one time and reuse it.
    ./stitchPlane /path/to/dir0/ /path/to/dir1/ ..../path/to/out/
(3) simpleStitchImages calc paras and stitch images in Plane mode.
    ./simpleStitchImages img1 img2 ...

Tools:
    (1) ./match_surf.cpp show the keypoints and matches between two images.
        ./match_surf img1 img2 [match_conf]
    (2) ./selectROI.cpp helps to select common area in images.
        ./selectROI img1 img2 ...
    (3) ./tool_crop crop the black boarder in stitching image.
        ./tool_crop img
